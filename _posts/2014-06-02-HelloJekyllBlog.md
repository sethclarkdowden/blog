>"Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites."
jekyll was created by Tom Preston-Werner the co-founder of github. It works seamlessly with github pages making it quick and easy to start a blog or static website in minuts.

incorporated is a jekyll app that has a very clean style and is a greate base for creating your own blog. just update your config.yml and started blogging. it took me longer to write this artical then it took me to set up this blog.

{% highlight yaml %}
~ $ https://github.com/kippt/jekyll-incorporated
~ $ cd jekyll-incorporated
~ $ git add --all
~ $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
~ $ git push
~ $ open http://username.github.io
{% endhighlight %}

It will take a few minuts befor you can open your new blog.
